<h1 align="center">CRAG LEADER - Bouldering Leaderboard CLI app</h1>

"Crag Leader" is an application built on a command-line interface, with the purpose of scraping climbing logs from a widely used online platform called [27crags](https://27crags.com/crags/inia-droushia/).

This app aims to process the scraped information and it is capable of displaying a number of leaderboards depending on the chosen criteria (overall, volume, unique ascent etc.), with a pre-defined scoring system. The current prototype version is focused on my local bouldering crag in Inia & Droushia of Cyprus but wider use of the app on other crags of the same platform is possible with some minor adjustments.
